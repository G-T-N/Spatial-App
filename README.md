# Spatial-App

## Description

<p>The full-stack spatial web app (referred to as the Spatial Web App) will be the next iteration of the current Excel based spatial separation table used internally by GHL tech staff.  The purpose of this app will be to provide an improved user experience compared to the existing spatial separation table, as well as provide a platform for future expansion into a deployable software as a service (SaaS) product.</p>

<p>The current Excel based spatial table does not have full Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) functionality, and is not a user intuitive design. Users currently need to have a high level of technical knowledge to use the spatial table, and the table is not easily accessible to users without sound knowledge of Excel, and extensive training of how to use the spreadsheet.  Inserting a new compartment calculation is not possible without unhiding rows and shifting down cells.  Deleting a row removes a 'link' to the calculations table, which is not ideal.  Excel in general is not an ideal platform for CRUD operations.</p>

## Features

The Spatial Web App will have full CRUD functionality

The app will be built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). The app will be built with a web first approach, and will be responsive to different screen sizes including mobile.  The app will be built with a user friendly interface, and will have full CRUD functionality.</p>

## Technologies Used

The tech stack will consist of the following technologies:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [mongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
